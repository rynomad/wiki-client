# Federated Wiki - Bars Plugin

The Bytebeat plugin generates 8 kHz sound samples by evaluating its own text as a c-like arithmetic expression in terms of t, the integer sample number.

Kragen Javier Sitaker has assembled a good introduction to the Bytebeat community [webpage](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/) His own composition, *Crowd*, served as the score for the short film *Exploring Cyberspace*.
